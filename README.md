## üìñOverview

This project is a database management application developed as part of the Database Design module coursework for MSc in Computing and Information Systems. It simulates a **College Library System** with functionalities to manage resources, loans, reservations, and fines effectively.

The project involved designing the database schema, normalizing it, and implementing it using **MySQL**. The system supports queries, views, and triggers to handle various library-related operations seamlessly.

## Features
- **Database Design**
  - [Conceptual Schema (ER Diagram)](./database-design/er-diagram.png): ER diagram following Chen notation.
  - [Relational Schema](./database-design/relational-schema.pdf): Derived from the ER diagram and normalized to 3NF.
  - [Normalization Documentation](./database-design/normalisation.pdf): Comprehensive documentation of the normalization process.
  - [Data Dictionary](./database-design/data-dictionary.pdf): Description of entities, attributes, and assumptions.

- **Database Implementation**
  - MySQL scripts for:
    - [Create Tables](./sql-scripts/create-tables.sql): Creating tables with primary/foreign key constraints and validation checks.
    - [Insert Data](./sql-scripts/insert-data.sql): Populating the database with significant test data.
    - [Create Views](./sql-scripts/create-views.sql): Specialized views tailored for different user groups.
    - [Queries](./sql-scripts/queries.sql): Pre-defined queries for common operations.
    - [Triggers](./sql-scripts/triggers.sql): Automation for actions like updating resource availability.
